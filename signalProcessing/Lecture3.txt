INTERCONNECTION OF SYSTEMS
	we can view the systems as interconnections of operations. we can represent the systems with block diagrams.
		EXAMPLE:
			Moving average system.
			Consider a DT-System
				y(n)=1/3(x[n]+x[n-1]+x[n-2])
				Show a block diagram represantation of the systems.
					x[n]-> H -> y[n]
				Let the operator S^K donate the following
					x[n]-> S^K -> x[n-1]
				Then the several system would be
					H=1/3[S^0+S^1+S^2]
					 =1/3[1+S+S^2]
			Cascade Form:
				x[n] -> S - x[n-1] > S - x[n-2] > 
						SUM OF ALL THREE
							1/3
							y(x)
			Parallel Form:
					Its impossible to show in here
